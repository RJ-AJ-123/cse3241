- Explanation of insert/delete dependency order.

### `project.sqlite`
- The finalized SQLite database file containing all tables, views, indexes, and at least 20 rows of sample data.

### `CreateDatabase.sql`
- All structural creation statements (CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW, CREATE INDEX).
- Well-commented and formatted for standalone execution.

### `LoadData.sql`
- All INSERT INTO statements, ordered to respect foreign-key dependencies.
- Includes controlled UPDATE or DELETE commands where necessary.

### `FinalQueries.sql`
- SELECT queries referenced in `FinalReport.pdf`.

## Rebuilding the Database
To rebuild the database from scratch, run the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
sqlite3 project.sqlite < CreateDatabase.sql
sqlite3 project.sqlite < LoadData.sql

Alternatively, open project.sqlite directly in:
    DataGrip or https://sqliteonline.com/
