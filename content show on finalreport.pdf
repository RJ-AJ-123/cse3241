Indexes
We created indexes to improve query performance, especially on columns that appear frequently in joins or WHERE clauses. Below is a list of our indexes and the rationale for each:
1.	Customers(CustomerID): Used to join with Purchases and Reviews tables to retrieve customer-related data quickly.
2.	Books(ISBN): Appears in many relationships (e.g., PurchaseDetails, Promotions, Reviews) and filters, making it crucial for joins.
3.	Purchases(PurchaseID, CustomerID): These keys support join operations with PurchaseDetails and user history queries.
4.	PurchaseDetails(PurchaseID, ISBN): Indexes on these columns enhance join speed for order breakdowns and reporting.
5.	Promotions(ISBN): Used to filter books that are currently on sale.
6.	Reviews(CustomerID, ISBN): These indexes help find reviews per user and per book, improving filtering and update operations.
7.	Reorders(ISBN, AdminID): Supports efficient access to reorder history based on books or administrators.
